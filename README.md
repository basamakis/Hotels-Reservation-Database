# Hotels-Reservation-Database

This is a Data Base Project for a course in my university.
In this project we created a Hotel Reservation System where you can register / login and make reservations or add your own hotels  and manage them using a GUI.
It conists of 2 folders: 
One contains files in mySQL where the database is created and some data used to initialize it.It also contains the queries that are used by python in a more simplistic way. 
The other contains python files where the GUI is created and handles the connection with the database.
